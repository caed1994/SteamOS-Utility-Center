"""The bridge between a window with no terminal and an installer wanting sudo.

The toolkit's installer refuses to run as root and calls `sudo` about forty
times. This script is what lets a GUI drive it: it runs as root through
pkexec, drops back to the desktop user, and lends that user a sudo rule for
the length of the install.

The rule needs the most tests. A bad file in /etc/sudoers.d stops sudo on
the complete machine. A file that stays gives a permission that no user
asked to keep. So the tests here prove two things: the file is valid before
the install, and each exit removes it.

Most of this only runs as root, because the thing being tested is a program
whose first act is to check that it is root. The decision tests above that
line run anywhere.
