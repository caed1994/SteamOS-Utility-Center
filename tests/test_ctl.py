"""The control surface that speaks JSON, and the promises it makes.

Nothing here writes to /etc and nothing here runs a program with root. The
appliers are recorded rather than run: a test that ran pkexec would ask
whoever runs the suite for a password.

Three of these tests are the reason this module exists at all.

`status` must start no process. A front end asks for it again and again while
a person watches a page, and a fork for each answer is a cost that a game
pays.

Nothing must print on stdout but the answer. A caller parses that text, and a
warning in the middle of it is an answer that no caller can read.

Nothing must ask for a password unless the caller permits it. Game Mode has no
polkit agent and no terminal, so a question there has nobody to answer it.
