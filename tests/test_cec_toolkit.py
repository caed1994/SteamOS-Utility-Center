"""The CEC module: the work of another project, forked, and kept complete.

This tree was a copy at one time, and the test here proved that the copy was
unchanged. It is no longer a copy, because this project corrected five faults
in it. See cec-toolkit/README.md. So the question is different now. Two
faults can occur with no message, and this file checks both.

A file goes missing. This project took the tree as a subtree, and the tree
installs itself from inside. A file that the installer needs, and that nobody
copied, looks correct here. It gives a broken install on a machine of a user.

The licence becomes difficult to find. This project cannot change the MIT
licence, and a fork with no record of its source is code with no history. The
record is ORIGIN. That file also makes "take the corrections of the source
project" a diff and not a guess.

No test here needs the network. The current state of the source project is
not available offline. The state of this tree is available, and this tree is
the half with the faults.
