"""The Game Mode plugin, and where it touches the rest of this project.

Nothing here runs Decky, and nothing here runs a browser. What is under test
is every seam that a person cannot see until the plugin is on a machine: a
method that the page calls and the backend does not have, an area name that
the command does not know, or a path that an update takes away.

The plugin holds no rule of its own, and the tests here are what keeps that
true. A rule that reaches the page is a second answer to a question that
