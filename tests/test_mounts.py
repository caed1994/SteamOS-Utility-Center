"""The drives that this machine mounts, and the files that carry them.

Nothing here mounts anything, and nothing here writes to /etc. The module
under test builds text and reads a record, and the step that needs root is
scripts/apply-mounts.sh. So each test runs on a build machine with one drive
and no second one.

The two tests that matter most are the unit name and the refusal. A unit whose
name is not the escaped mount point never mounts, and systemd reports nothing
about it. A unit on /usr replaces the system with somebody's games drive at
the next boot.
