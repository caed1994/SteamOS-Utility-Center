    A ttk.Combobox opens a Tk listbox, and that listbox gives three problems.
    First, it holds text only, so a list of colours cannot show the colours.
    Second, it cannot take the look of the other controls. Tk draws its text as
    a *selection*, and "stretch" and "bloom" therefore came out pale grey on
    pale grey. Third, Tk posts it under a grab and does not release it, so it
    stayed above each window over the panel.

    The settings pages moved to a field of our own; the branch and firmware
    fields on Status & repair were left behind and still had all three. So
    this is checked by reading the source rather than by remembering: the next
    combobox added would bring the same three back with it.
