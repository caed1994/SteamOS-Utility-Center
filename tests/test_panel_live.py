"""The window, actually built.

Everything else about the panel is checked by reading its source, because a
build machine has neither tkinter nor a display. That catches misspelled style
names and settings that do not exist, and it cannot catch the other kind of
mistake at all: the rail that highlighted the wrong page was a perfectly
well-spelled line of code.

So this file builds the real window when there is something to build it with,
and skips otherwise. It is the only test here that needs a display.
