"""One control surface for this project, which speaks JSON.

The panel imports these modules and calls them. A plugin in Game Mode cannot:
it is a process of another program, with a web page inside Steam for a front
end. It needs a command that prints an answer.

    steamos-utility-centerctl status
    steamos-utility-centerctl get strip
    steamos-utility-centerctl set strip '{"NOTIFY": false}'
    steamos-utility-centerctl action cec-wake

`set` takes a JSON object rather than one command for each setting, so a new
setting is no work here at all. See AREA.

Three rules give this file its shape.

**One object on stdout, and nothing else.** A message for a person goes to
stderr. Every command prints an object with `ok` in it, and the exit status
agrees with that field.

**`status` starts no process.** A front end asks for it again and again while
a person watches a page, so it reads files and nothing more. `status --full`
is the half that needs `systemctl`, the toolkit and lsblk, asked one time when
a page opens.

**Nothing asks for a password unless the caller permits it.** Game Mode runs
no polkit agent and gives no terminal, so `pkexec` there fails after a delay
and says nothing. This uses `sudo -n`, which works or refuses at once, and the
refusal names the file that would make it work. `--may-prompt` is for a caller
with a desktop around it.
