"""Talking to the television over HDMI, through the CEC toolkit.

Almost none of the CEC work is ours. It is the SteamOS CEC Toolkit, under
cec-toolkit/. Its ORIGIN records where it came from, and its README.md gives
the changes and their reasons.

This module is the thin connection between that toolkit and this panel. It
builds the commands and reads the answers of `steamos-cec-toolkitctl`. It
reads no device, runs no systemctl and edits no configuration file, so the
toolkit stays the one program that knows how CEC operates. It is also testable
on a machine with no television, no adapter and no toolkit.

Two results are important.

**To install it needs root. To use it does not.** The toolkit's installer
writes a sudoers file for the helpers its own switches need. Each switch on
the page is thus an ordinary command that runs as the user, with no password
and no Apply button. The LED pages wait for Apply because they write /etc.

**Each answer comes from the machine.** The list here is names and words.
Whether a feature is on, installable or possible comes from `toolkitctl
status` at the moment of the question.
