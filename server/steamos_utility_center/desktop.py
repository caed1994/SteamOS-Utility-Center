"""What the bar shows while Steam does not control it.

Steam writes the LED state in Game Mode only, so on the desktop the bar keeps
what the last Game Mode session left. This module gives that decision to the
person at the machine instead. The bar is Steam's again when Game Mode
returns.

A scene is a *snapshot*, built as the shim builds one and drawn by the
renderer that draws Steam's. "Breath in this colour" is thus the same
arithmetic for both callers.

The difficult part is the mode of the machine. The service is a system
service with no session of its own, so it asks the process table instead.
gamescope is the compositor of Game Mode. `steamos-utility-center --desktop`
reports what it found.
