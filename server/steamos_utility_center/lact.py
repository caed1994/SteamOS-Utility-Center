"""Communication with LACT, when LACT is present.

LACT is the Linux AMDGPU Controller Tool. It is another person's daemon, and it
owns the power limit, the clocks, the voltage and the fans of the graphics
card.

No part of LACT is in this repository and there is nothing to install. Either
lactd runs on this machine or it does not.

**The protocol.** The daemon listens on a unix socket and speaks JSON, one
document on each line. `socket` and `json` are the whole client.

    {"command": "list_devices"}
    {"status": "ok", "data": [{"id": "...", "name": "..."}]}

**No password is necessary.** The daemon gives its socket to the first group
of `wheel` and `sudo` that exists, and the SteamOS desktop user is in `wheel`.
A machine configured otherwise reports a refused connection.

**Two things need care.** A mistake in either is expensive on another person's
machine.

A configuration change is *pending* until a confirmation. `set_gpu_config`
answers with a number of seconds, and without `confirm_pending_config` inside
that time the daemon puts the old settings back. That is what makes a wrong
voltage a mistake and not a machine that cannot boot, so this module models it.

The values a card accepts are different for each card, and the clocks table is
a tagged union whose shape belongs to the manufacturer and the generation.
This module searches for the ranges rather than read a fixed position, and it
draws no control it cannot find a range for.

    the firmware, and they apply while the card controls its own fan.
