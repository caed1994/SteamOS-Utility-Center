"""Which parts of this project a machine has, and what each part does.

install.sh installs the panel, the control command and the shared code. That
is the whole of the core. The LED bar, the CPU and GPU power, HDMI CEC and the
drives are modules. A person takes each module from its own page in the panel,
and gives it back on the same page.

The reason is the cost of the parts. The LED module builds a kernel module and
downloads PlatformIO, and a person with no ESP board on the machine paid that
cost for nothing. The other three are smaller, and the same argument holds:
a unit that nobody asked for is a unit that a person must examine.

-- how this file answers "is it installed" ---------------------------------

Each module is present when one file is present, and that file is the applier
of the module. There is no record of "what the person asked for" beside it.

A record and a machine can disagree, and then one question has two answers.
This project met that shape twice already, in the LACT status and in the
handover out of Game Mode, and both times the cost was an evening.

The applier is also the file that the sudoers rule names. So the rule is
exactly the list of installed modules, and neither of the two can move away
from the other. See ctl.sudoers_text.

HDMI CEC has no applier. It is somebody else's toolkit, it installs into the
home directory of the user, and it answers this question itself. This file
asks it rather than keeping a second answer. See cec.installed.
