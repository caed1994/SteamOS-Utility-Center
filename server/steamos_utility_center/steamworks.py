"""Achievement detection through Valve's local Steamworks API.

This needs no API key and no network. The Steam client already knows the
achievement state, and `libsteam_api.so` is the local interface to it.

Steamworks is a *game-side* API: a program starts it as one specific app, and
it cannot report which game runs. This module thus finds the app ID first.

It uses the flat C API only, so ctypes is sufficient and it marshals no
callback structures.
