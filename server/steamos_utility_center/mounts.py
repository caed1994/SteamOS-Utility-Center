"""The drives that this machine mounts, and how they survive a SteamOS update.

A SteamOS update writes the new image into the other partition slot and boots
into it. /etc belongs to that image, so a line that a person adds to
/etc/fstab is in the old slot only. The new slot has the fstab of the image,
and the line is gone. /home and /var are their own partitions and stay.

So this project writes one systemd mount unit for each drive and does not
write /etc/fstab. systemd builds the same units from fstab, so this is the
same mechanism one level down. fstab also holds the entries for /, /boot,
/home and /var, and a copy of it that survives an update writes those over the
entries of the new image. A mount unit is this project's file alone.

Three things carry a drive across an update:

- /var/lib/steamos-utility-center/mounts.conf is the record of what a person
  asked for. /var is its own partition, so this file stays.
- /etc/atomic-update.conf.d/steamos-utility-center.conf asks SteamOS to keep
  the units. See keep_list_text.
- steamos-utility-center-mounts.service writes the units again at each boot
  from the record above. This covers an image that does not honour the
  keep-list.

Nothing here writes to /etc. To write a unit needs root, and that work is in
scripts/apply-mounts.sh. This module is the half that a test can read.
