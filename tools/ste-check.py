"""Checks the text of this project against the rules in docs/STYLE.md.

The rules that a program can check are a subset of ASD-STE100. Vocabulary is
not one of them: the specification has a dictionary of approximately 900 words,
and a project that adds technical names to it needs a person to decide what is
a technical name. Sentence length, verb form, and punctuation are countable,
and they are also the rules that a writer breaks without knowing it.

Usage:

    python3 tools/ste-check.py                 # each file the rules apply to
    python3 tools/ste-check.py README.md       # one file
    python3 tools/ste-check.py --quiet         # the count only

It reads prose. It does not read code: an indented block, a fenced block, a
table row, a URL, and a shell command are all data, and the rules do not apply
to data.
