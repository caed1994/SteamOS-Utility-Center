"""Draws the effect previews of the README, from the renderer.

GitHub runs no JavaScript in a README, so the previews must be images.

They are animated PNG files and not GIF files. A GIF has 256 colours, and
these images are gradients. A palette cannot show a gradient.

An APNG is PNG chunks and three more chunks, so zlib from the standard
library is the one package that this needs.

Nothing here writes an effect a second time. The two gauges read a sensor
from a script, because a machine does not go from 25 to 95 degrees on
request. render.py and notify.py draw each frame, as the service uses
them.
