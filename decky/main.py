"""The Game Mode half of the SteamOS Utility Center.

This holds no rules. Every method starts steamos-utility-centerctl and gives
back what it printed. The rules are in the same modules that the panel calls,
and one copy of them is one answer to each question. See
server/steamos_utility_center/ctl.py.

The shape of this file, and the three environment variables that it corrects,
come from the Decky plugin of the SteamOS CEC Toolkit by Twsts, which is MIT.
That plugin is the other front end of the toolkit in cec-toolkit/. See
cec-toolkit/ORIGIN.

# module. /var/lib is a partition of its own and it stays.
