# Two units call this: steamos-utility-center-sleep.service with "pre" before
# a suspend, and steamos-utility-center-resume.service with "post" after a
# wake. systemd waits for the first one, and that wait is the point of it.
# The strip must get the message before systemd freezes the service.
#
# This was a program in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep before, which systemd
# runs at the same two moments with the same two words. A SteamOS update
# rebuilds /usr and took the file away each time, so the strip went dark at
# the first suspend after an update. The units are in /etc, which the
# keep-list carries. See server/steamos_utility_center/mounts.py.
#
# It writes a word into the service's trigger pipe rather than talking to the
# serial port, because the service holds that port exclusively. The pipe is
# world-writable and already read in the service's main loop.
