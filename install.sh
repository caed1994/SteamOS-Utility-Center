Modules:
  --with LIST     install these as well, e.g. --with led,power or --with all
  --without LIST  take these back off the machine
  --modules       say what each module is, and what this machine has

Options:
  --leds N        number of LEDs on the strip (default: 17)
  --port PATH     serial device, or "auto" (default: auto)
  --baud RATE     serial baud rate (default: 230400)
  --skip-module   do not touch the leds-valve-shim kernel module
  --rebuild-module  rebuild and reinstall the module even if it is loaded
  --skip-watcher  do not install the desktop-session user services
  --no-sudoers    do not permit a change with no password. Game Mode then
                  reads every setting and changes none of them.
  --flash ENV     also flash the ESP firmware (e.g. nodemcuv2, esp32dev),
                  or a number from the menu; omit to be asked, 0 to skip
  -y, --yes       accept defaults, no prompts
  -h, --help      this text

--leds, --port, --baud and --flash are settings of the LED module, so any of
them asks for that module.
