# Troubleshooting

## After a SteamOS Update

SteamOS updates can reset system-level pieces that this toolkit depends on:

- `/etc/sudoers.d/zz-steamos-cec-toolkit-volume`
- `/var/lib/steamos-cec-toolkit/*`
- `/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-before-sleep.service`
- `/etc/systemd/system/steamos-cec-permissions.service`
- `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-steamos-cec-toolkit.rules`
- user service state and WirePlumber behavior
- Decky Loader installation or plugin loading

Version `v0.1.15` and newer install:

```text
/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf
```

On SteamOS builds that honor `/etc/atomic-update.conf.d`, this asks the OS to
preserve the toolkit-managed `/etc` files across atomic updates. This reduces
how often a SteamOS update breaks the toolkit, but it cannot protect Decky
Loader, SteamOS internals, WirePlumber behavior changes, or files outside the
configured keep-list.

`steamos-cec-toolkitctl status` makes this visible:

- helper or sudoers entries report missing
- `external_volume_enabled` is false
- `relative_volume` is inactive

Repair by reinstalling this module - from the SteamOS Utility Center's HDMI CEC
page, or by hand from the checkout:

```bash
./install.sh
```

Do **not** repair with upstream's release installer. This is a fork; that
installer would put the unfixed programs and units back. See ORIGIN.

To also run SteamOS atomic-update verification when the SteamOS image provides
`holo-sync-var`:

```bash
./install.sh --verify
```

Then re-enable the features you want. User-level runtime config is stored in
`~/.config/steamos-cec-toolkit/config.conf` and should normally survive OS
updates.

## Game Mode Still Shows a Normal Slider

After first install or after enabling `CEC Volume Buttons`, reboot once before
debugging this. The Decky volume action buttons can work before Steam/Game Mode
has reloaded the PipeWire ExternalVolume route that changes Quick Settings from
a slider to `+` / `-`.

Check that WirePlumber has ExternalVolume enabled:

```bash
pw-dump | grep -E \
  'monitor.alsa.enable-external-volume-control|api.alsa.external-volume-control|steamos.supports-hdmi-cec'
```

Check capabilities:

```bash
varlinkctl call \
  unix:/run/user/1000/cec-audio-control/org.pipewire.ExternalVolume \
  org.pipewire.ExternalVolume.GetCapabilities \
  '{"device":""}'
```

The output must include:

```text
writeVolumeRelative:true
routes:["hdmi-output-0"]
```

If capabilities are correct but Steam still shows a slider, restart Steam/Game
Mode or reboot.

## `+` / `-` Shows but the Receiver Volume Does Not Move

Test the direct wrapper:

```bash
sudo -k
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-volume up
sleep 1
~/.local/bin/steamos-cec-volume down
```

If this asks for a password, the sudoers rule is missing or wrong.

Check topology:

```bash
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 --show-topology
```

If your Audio System logical address is not `5`, update:

```bash
CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS=5
```

in `/etc/steamos-cec-toolkit.conf`.

If your receiver accepts normal playback-device volume commands, leave the
initiator empty so the kernel uses the SteamOS adapter's current logical
address and validates the message:

```bash
CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR=
```

If it only accepts TV-originated volume commands, keep:

```bash
CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR=0
```

## Volume Does Nothing on an LG TV With No Receiver

This is a different failure than the receiver case above, with a different fix.

Check topology:

```bash
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 --show-topology
```

If there is no `Audio System` device listed, the TV renders its own audio.
Set:

```bash
CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS=0
CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR=
```

leaving `CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR` empty so the kernel supplies the adapter's own
logical address and validates the frame. If the TV's `Vendor ID` in the
topology output is `0x00e091` (LG), also set:

```bash
CEC_SIMPLINK_ACK=1
```

LG TVs run a vendor extension called SIMPLINK on top of standard HDMI-CEC and
gate `User Control Pressed` (the opcode volume/mute use) behind a SIMPLINK
vendor-command handshake. Without it, the TV silently drops volume keys while
continuing to answer unrelated CEC queries like power status normally, which
makes it look like nothing is happening at all rather than failing loudly.

Confirm with a bus capture. This needs root:

```bash
sudo cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 -s --monitor-all --monitor-time 20 --show-raw --wall-clock
```

A `FEATURE_ABORT` reply to `VENDOR_COMMAND (0x89)` with payload `0x01` is the
signature of a refused SIMPLINK handshake — the TV is trying to establish a
SIMPLINK session and the connected device (previously this toolkit) is
rejecting it.

LG's SIMPLINK also only responds to an adapter that has announced a vendor
ID. SteamOS's own `cecd.service` owns the adapter in the background and
usually auto-matches the adapter's vendor ID to the connected TV's, but that
auto-match is not guaranteed to have happened yet — most commonly right
after boot or a fresh HDMI connect, before `cecd` has observed the TV on the
bus. When `CEC_SIMPLINK_ACK=1`, the volume script checks for this itself
(`cec-ctl -d "$CEC_DEVICE"`, looking for a `Vendor ID` line) and claims
`CEC_SIMPLINK_VENDOR_ID` (default `0x00e091`, LG) only when it's actually
missing, so this should self-heal without any action on your part. If
volume still does nothing, confirm:

```bash
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 | grep "Vendor ID"
```

No output means the adapter has no vendor ID claimed. If it stays empty
across repeated volume attempts, something is preventing the script's own
claim from succeeding — check that `/usr/bin/cec-ctl` is reachable from the
script's context (root, via the sudoers rule) and not just your shell.

**While diagnosing manually, avoid running `cec-ctl --playback`,
`--vendor-id`, `--clear`, or anything else that reclaims the adapter's
logical address** in a tight loop, even though the script above does this
safely on its own. Reclaiming the adapter races with `cecd`: it reacts by
briefly resetting its own logical address and vendor ID before reasserting
them, and while that race is in progress, volume commands from *either*
side can transiently fail. `--show-topology` and a bare `cec-ctl -d
/dev/cec0` are both read-only and always safe to run.

If a transmit reports success but nothing happens and none of the above
explains it, remember that `--raw-msg` (used only when `CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR`
is explicitly set to something other than `CEC_AUDIO_LOGICAL_ADDRESS`)
suppresses all kernel-side validation of the frame. A transmit can exit 0
while having sent a malformed or nonsensically-addressed message. Prefer
leaving `CEC_VOLUME_INITIATOR` empty so the kernel validates every frame
before it goes out.

## Audio Device Disappears

Rollback the ExternalVolume integration:

```bash
rm -f ~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/99-steamos-cec-external-volume.conf
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/cec-audio-control.service.d/override.conf
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart wireplumber.service
systemctl --user stop cec-audio-control.service
systemctl --user start cec-audio-control.socket
wpctl status
```

Then inspect:

```bash
journalctl --user -b -u wireplumber.service --no-pager
journalctl --user -b -u cec-audio-control.service --no-pager
```

## Controller Button Does Not Switch Input

Check the service:

```bash
systemctl --user status steamos-cec-steam-button.service --no-pager
journalctl --user -b -u steamos-cec-steam-button.service --no-pager
```

Check whether the controller HID ID matches:

```bash
for d in /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/uevent; do
  echo "$d"
  grep -E 'HID_ID|HID_PHYS|HID_NAME' "$d"
done
```

Update these values if needed:

```bash
STEAM_BUTTON_HID_ID=
STEAM_BUTTON_EXCLUDED_PHYS=
STEAM_BUTTON_REPORT_ID=
STEAM_BUTTON_BYTE=
STEAM_BUTTON_MASK=
```

For non-Steam-Controller gamepads, run `steamos-cec-toolkitctl discover-input`
first. Generic controller wake listens for gamepad-like Linux input devices
and supported Home/Guide button events.

The included parser is known to target the original Steam Controller. Other
controllers may need a small code change.

## Bluetooth Wake Resumes to No Display or No SSH

If Bluetooth/controller wake powers the PC but SteamOS does not fully resume,
this is usually below the CEC layer. A common symptom is that the machine still
responds to ping, but Game Mode never appears and SSH does not answer.

Check BIOS/firmware power-management settings. On one AMD desktop reference
build with an internal Intel Bluetooth adapter, setting `Power Supply Idle
Control` to `Typical Current Idle` and disabling `Global C-state Control`
stabilized Bluetooth controller wake from suspend.

Keep `Bluetooth/Controller Wake` disabled while testing BIOS changes. Once
manual sleep/resume is stable, enable only that feature and test controller wake
before enabling CEC input switching or TV standby features.

## `dbus_next` Missing

The Steam-button and ExternalVolume pieces do not need `dbus_next`.

The optional TV standby, input inactive suspend, and Gamescope recovery services use
`dbus_next`. If the module is missing, install it using your preferred
SteamOS-safe Python packaging approach or leave those optional services disabled.

## Inspect the Official SteamOS CEC Service

```bash
systemctl --user cat cec-audio-control.socket cec-audio-control.service
varlinkctl introspect \
  unix:/run/user/1000/cec-audio-control/org.pipewire.ExternalVolume \
  org.pipewire.ExternalVolume
```

Note: on current SteamOS builds, introspection says `GetCapabilities -> ()`,
but the real service returns a capabilities object. The shim intentionally
matches the real behavior.
