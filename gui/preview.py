"""Shows the effects of this project, before the user applies a setting.

This module holds the effects that this project added, and no other effect:

- the four effects. In Game Mode one of them uses the rainbow slot, and on
  the desktop each one has its own scene.
- the six notification shapes.

The effects of Steam are not here, because the user can select one and look
at it. The standby breath and the startup breath are not here either. The
machine enters those two states itself, and they are not settings.

This module does not use tkinter, and ledpanel.py does the same. This module
decides the value of each pixel, and a machine with no display must be able
to test it. The panel holds the canvas.

The frames come from render.py and notify.py, so the preview always agrees
with the strip. This module also reads the settings in the window and not the
settings on disk. It therefore shows the result of the next Apply, and not
the effect that runs now.
